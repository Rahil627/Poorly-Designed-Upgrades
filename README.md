Poorly-Designed-Upgrades
========================

a game prototype with two ideas: the playerâ€™s drawings affect gameplay and too many upgrades can lead to negative results

this project also serves as a good example to come back to, to refresh my mind

since this was only my second game prototype, and my first time using the FlashPunk engine (the first game prototype used only pure Flash), and with a time limit (Experimental Gameplay Project), i chose to implement this idea on top of the shoot 'em up genre, as a sort of learning project.

the main idea / experiment driving this was to make let drawing input affect gameplay At the time I really liked the idea of iPads as a game platform, so drawing was on my mind. Also, I just don't think many games made good use of drawing input, where it actually affect gameplay.

for this prototype to rock, i shouldn't have seperated the drawing screen from the playing screen. The player should have been able to draw in-game, having to draw the correct configuration of weapon upgrades as needed to defeat enemies... the code is there though, just needs a little re-ordering.
